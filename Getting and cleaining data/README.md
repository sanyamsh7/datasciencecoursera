# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository is a work of **Sanyam Sharma** as a submission to the **_Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project_**. Files contain the analysis code and the tidy data produced after analysis.

## Dataset
[**Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones**](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files
-**Codebook.md** describes the variables, data, and any operations I performed in the process of cleaning the data. 

-**run_analysis.R** reads both the training and test data provided and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:

    -Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    -Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    -Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    -Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    -From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
     of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  
-**Final_Data.txt** contains the exported tidy data after performing all the steps given above.
